# Salary Classification Project

## Overview

The Salary Classification Project aims to predict whether an individual's annual salary exceeds $50,000 based on demographic and employment-related features. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can analyze the dataset to uncover patterns and relationships that influence salary levels.

## Project Structure
## Libraries Used

This project utilizes the following Python libraries:

- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy**: For numerical operations and handling arrays.
- **matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **seaborn**: For enhanced statistical graphics.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following columns:

- **age**: Age of the individual.
- **workclass**: Employment type (e.g., Private, Government).
- **fnlwgt**: Final weight (a measure of the population represented).
- **education**: Highest level of education.
- **education-num**: Number of years of education.
- **marital-status**: Marital status of the individual.
- **occupation**: Job title.
- **relationship**: Relationship status in the household.
- **race**: Race of the individual.
- **gender**: Gender of the individual.
- **capital-gain**: Capital gains from investments.
- **capital-loss**: Capital losses from investments.
- **hours-per-week**: Average hours worked per week.
- **native-country**: Country of origin.
- **salary**: Income class (<=50K or >50K).

## Data Cleaning

Data cleaning processes include:

- Checking for and handling missing values.
- Removing duplicate records.
- Replacing noise or erroneous data points with appropriate values.
- Ensuring correct data types for analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA involves visualizing the data to understand distributions and relationships between features. Key analyses include:

- Distribution of ages across different salary classes.
- Correlation heatmaps to identify relationships between variables.
- Box plots to detect outliers in numerical features.

## Machine Learning

The project implements various machine learning algorithms for salary classification, including:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Conclusions

The analysis aims to provide insights into the factors that influence salary levels and to develop a robust predictive model. The findings can help stakeholders understand demographic trends and inform policy decisions.
